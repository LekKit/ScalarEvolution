- Consider contributing to [RVVM](https://github.com/LekKit/RVVM)

Currently targeted at Minecraft 1.7.10. It might eventually get ported to 1.12.2 and 1.16.5+.

## Building
```shell
$ ./gradlew build
```

## Is this an OC2 ripoff?

**No.** The idea to make this mod came much earlier, but took a lot of time to bring it to working state.\
It was originally inspired by the long-forgotten OCMIPS. and lunatic86 projects. Then OC2 project was kind of a simultaneous invention.

When I saw the OC2 project I originally wanted to propose RVVM to them for performance reasons, but RVVM wasn't even as advanced back then to propose anything.\
I decided to continue working on my mod instead of giving up, since it still has many different goals.
